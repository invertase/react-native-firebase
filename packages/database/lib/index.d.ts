     * Atomically modify the data at this location. Unlike a normal `set()`, which just overwrites
     * the data regardless of its previous value, `transaction()` is used to modify the existing
     * value to a new value, ensuring there are no conflicts with other clients writing to the same
     * location at the same time.
     *
     * To accomplish this, you pass `transaction()` an update function which is used to transform the
     * current value into a new value. If another client writes to the location before your new
     * value is successfully written, your update function will be called again with the new
     * current value, and the write will be retried. This will happen repeatedly until your write
     * succeeds without conflict or you abort the transaction by not returning a value from your
     * update function.
     *
     * Note: Modifying data with `set()` will cancel any pending transactions at that location, so
     * extreme care should be taken if mixing `set()` and `transaction()` to update the same data.
     *
     * Note: When using transactions with Security and Firebase Rules in place, be aware that a
     * client needs `.read` access in addition to `.write` access in order to perform a transaction.
     * This is because the client-side nature of transactions requires the client to read the data
     * in order to transactionally update it.
     *
     * #### Example
     *
     * ```js
     * const userRef = firebase.database().ref('users/ada/profileViews);
     *
     * userRef.transaction((currentViews) => {
     *   if (currentViews === null) return 1;
     *   return currentViews + 1;
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * @param transactionUpdate A developer-supplied function which will be passed the current data stored at this location (as a JavaScript object). The function should return the new value it would like written (as a JavaScript object). If undefined is returned (i.e. you return with no result) the transaction will be aborted and the data at this location will not be modified.
     * @param onComplete A callback function that will be called when the transaction completes. The callback is passed three arguments: a possibly-null Error, a boolean indicating whether the transaction was committed, and a DataSnapshot indicating the final result. If the transaction failed abnormally, the first argument will be an Error object indicating the failure cause. If the transaction finished normally, but no data was committed because no data was returned from transactionUpdate, then second argument will be false. If the transaction completed and committed data to Firebase, the second argument will be true. Regardless, the third argument will be a DataSnapshot containing the resulting data in this location.
     * @param applyLocally By default, events are raised each time the transaction update function runs. So if it is run multiple times, you may see intermediate states. You can set this to false to suppress these intermediate states and instead wait until the transaction has completed before events are raised.
