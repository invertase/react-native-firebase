**Pull Request**: [#3537](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/pull/3537)

### RemoteConfig Module

```js
const remoteConfig = firebase.remoteConfig();
```

#### Updates

- added `ensureInitialized` API.
- added `reset` API for android only
- `console.warn()` if user tries to set `defaultConfig` which is part of web sdk.
- `console.warn()` if user tries to set `settings` which is part of web sdk.
- `console.warn()` if user tries to set `setLogLevel` which is part of web sdk.

### RemoteConfig.setConfigSettings()

```js
const remoteConfig = firebase.remoteConfig().setConfigSettings({});
```

#### Updates

- can set 'minimumFetchIntervalMillis' in `setConfigSettings` to match web sdk.
- can set 'fetchTimeMillis' in `setConfigSettings` to match web sdk.

#### Removed

- `isDeveloperModeEnabled` from config settings and console.warn() if tried to set.
- `minimumFetchInterval` config setting and console.warn() if tried to set.

### RemoteConfig.getValue(key)

```js
const remoteConfig = firebase.remoteConfig().getValue('key');
```

#### Updates

- `asBoolean()` resolves value to a boolean.
- `asNumber()` resolves value to a number.
- `asString()` resolves value to a string.
- `getSource()` source of the property.

#### Removed

- `value` removed property. Not sure how to warn users it is no longer available

- Switched to `fetchAndActivate` API for both platforms.
- Switched to async `activate` API for iOS. No changes needed for Android.
- Multiple Firebase apps now supported on both platforms.
