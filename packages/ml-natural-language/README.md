# DEPRECATED

This package is deprecated and should no longer be used.

Google has split mobile machine learning functionality into two pieces:

1. "On-Device" inferences - this will be handled via the standalone ["Google ML Kit"](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) libraries, and the related [`react-native-mlkit`](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-mlkit) package. This includes any APIs where the device uses a local model to make inferences

1. "Cloud" inferences - these will continue in Firebase, but are now in the ["Firebase ML"](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml) library, and will be available from the new consolidated `@react-native-firebase/ml` package

More information on the transition is available here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml#cloud_vs_on-device
