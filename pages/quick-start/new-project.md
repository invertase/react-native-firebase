# Create a New Project

This guide is for starting a **new** React Native app with Firebase pre-integrated.

For pre-existing React Native projects see the [`existing projects guide`](/quick-start/existing-project)

## Guide

Let's 'init' a project using the React Native CLI with the React Native Firebase project template:

#### Init Project from Template

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli@next init --template=@react-native-firebase/template@alpha <myProjectName>
```

> Substitute `<myProjectName>` for the name of your new project.

This will create a new React Native project in a folder called `<myProjectName>` with the `@react-react-native/app` package pre installed. The generated java package name will be `com.<myProjectName>`, while the XCode iOS Bundle Identifier will have the format `org.reactjs.native.example.<myProjectName>`

## Next

Now that you have a new project with the core Firebase module integrated, let's continue to the final step; follow the guides below for the platforms you wish to integrate with.
