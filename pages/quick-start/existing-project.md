# Integrate Into Existing Project

This guide is for integrating Firebase into an existing React Native project.

Creating a new React Native project? See the [new projects guide](/quick-start/new-project) instead.

## Adding the app dependency

Every project using React Native Firebase requires the `app` module to be installed. Using Yarn, add the module to your
project:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-firebase/app
```

If you are using React Native <= 0.59 you need to manually integrate the `app` module into your project.
See the following steps for [Android](/v6/app/android) and [iOS](/v6/app/ios) for more information on manual linking.

For users on React Native >= 0.60, the module will be automatically linked to your project.

## Next

Now that you've installed the core Firebase module into your existing project, you now need to setup your project
with Android & iOS:

<Grid columns="2">
	<Block
		title="Android: Setting up Firebase"
		to="/quick-start/android-firebase-credentials"
		icon="android"
		color="#4CAF50"
	>
		Adding Firebase credentials to your Android app.
	</Block>
	<Block
		title="iOS: Setting up Firebase"
		to="/quick-start/ios-firebase-credentials"
		icon="phone_iphone"
		color="#2196F3"
	>
		Adding Firebase credentials to your iOS app.
	</Block>
</Grid>
