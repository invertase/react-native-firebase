# Creating a new Firebase project

The first thing you'll need to have to use Firebase is an active Firebase project; let's quickly cover creating one.

## Guide

- Visit the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=quick-start)
- Click the `Add project` box as shown below:

- A dialog will appear as shown below
  - Enter your new **project name** and modify the **project ID** and **region** if necessary
  - Click `Create Project` when finished
  - Your project will now be created - this can take a few seconds
  - Once created click the `Continue` button

Now that you have a Firebase project; lets continue integrating Firebase for React Native.

You can get started with Firebase in React Native using one of the following options:

<Grid columns="2">
	<Block
		title="New Projects"
		to="/quick-start/new-project"
		icon="fiber_new"
		color="#4CAF50"
	>
		Start a new React Native project with Firebase pre-integrated.
	</Block>
	<Block
		title="Existing Projects"
		to="/quick-start/existing-project"
		icon="forward"
		color="#ffc107"
	>
		Integrate Firebase into an existing React Native project.
	</Block>
</Grid>
