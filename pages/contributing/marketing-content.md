# Marketing & Content

## Marketing

If you're running a marketing campaign which helps promote React Native Firebase, or Firebase we may be able to help
give it extra attention using the website and/or social media platforms. Please send all enquires to [oss@invertase.io](oss@invertase.io).

## Content Submission

Have you written an article/blog post about React Native Firebase? We're always looking for external content
to help promote the library and we'd love to have this featured on this website. We are supportive of both
self hosted content (such a a Wordpress website) or 3rd party hosted (such as Medium).

### Self hosted content

Please send us a link to your content. After successful review, we'll automatically add this to our website in
the appropriate area. Content will be 301 directed from the website to the external content.
