# Releases

React Native Firebase versioning follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention.

Each major version gets its own documentation section with detailed change logs outlined below. Ideally, we aim to release at most 1 major release every 6-12 months, however; due to having to cater for breaking changes / new features on the Firebase [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/ios), [Android](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android) and [JavaScript](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js) SDKs as well as React Native currently being non-semver: this may occur more frequently.
