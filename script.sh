# Another is new modules located at https://vercel.com/invertase/react-native-firebase-next

# This script when combined with the ignore build step command https://vercel.com/invertase/react-native-firebase-next/settings/git
# ensures that only the @invertase/next will cause a build on the new modules deployments.

# This does not affect the main production deployment.
