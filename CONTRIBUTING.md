# Contribute

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing to react-native-firebase! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ðŸ˜Š

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with

* **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. platform versions, screenshots sdk versions & logs)
* **Docs**: improve reference coverage, add more examples, fix typos or anything else you can spot. At the top of every page on our docs site you can click the `Edit` pencil to go to that pages markdown file, or view the [Docs Repo](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase-docs) directly
* **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...
* **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...
* **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.
* **Money**: we welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/react-native-firebase).
* **Premium Starter Kits**: purchasing one of our starter kits helps us continue to develop the library and support its ever growing community (and you get something too!). [View Kits](http://invertase.link/get-started-premium)

## Your First Contribution

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Submitting code

Any code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests where possible.

## Code review process

The bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.
It is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you? Tag in any linked issues.

## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/react-native-firebase).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
