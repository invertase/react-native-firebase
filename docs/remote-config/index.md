# Remote Config

React Native Firebase provides native integration with Remote Config, allowing you to change the appearance
and/or functionality of your app without requiring an app update. Remote Config values added into the Firebase
console are accessible via a JavaScript API, giving you full control over when and how these are applied and take
effect within your application.
