# App Indexing

Firebase App Indexing gets your app into Google Search. If users have your app installed, they can launch your app and
go directly to the content they're searching for. App Indexing reengages your app users by helping them find both public 
and personal content right on their device, even offering query autocompletions to help them more quickly find what they
need. If users donâ€™t yet have your app, relevant queries trigger an install card for your app in Search results.
  
React Native Firebase provides functionality to handle events such as users opening the application via a URL which 
has been indexed by Firebase.
