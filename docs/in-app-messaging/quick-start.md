# Firebase In-App Messaging Quick Start

## Installation

This module depends on the `@react-native-firebase/app` module. To get started and install `app`,
visit the project's <Anchor version={false} group={false} href="/quick-start">quick start</Anchor> guide.

Install this module with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-firebase/in-app-messaging

# Using iOS
cd ios/ && pod install
```

> Integrating manually and not via React Native auto-linking? Check the setup instructions for <Anchor version group href="/android">Android</Anchor> & <Anchor version group href="/ios">iOS</Anchor>.

## Module usage

Once installed, any published campaigns from the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=fiam&utm_campaign=quick_start)
are automatically handled and displayed on your users device. The module provides a JavaScript API to allow greater
control of the displaying of these messages.

Once installed, import the FIAM package into your project:

```js
import inAppMessaging from '@react-native-firebase/in-app-messaging';
```

The package also provides access to the firebase instance:

```js
import { firebase } from '@react-native-firebase/in-app-messaging';
```

### Suppressing messages

The Firebase console campaign manager provides a few events to handle when messages are displayed to users. In some
situations you may want to handle this manually to only display messages at a chosen time, for example once a user
has completed an on-boarding process within your app. The `setMessagesDisplaySuppressed` method can be used to
achieve this.

> The suppressed state is not persisted between restarts, so ensure it is called as early as possible.

```js
import inAppMessaging from '@react-native-firebase/in-app-messaging';

async function bootstrap() {
  await inAppMessaging().setMessagesDisplaySuppressed(true);
}

async function onSetup(user) {
  await setupUser(user);
  // Allow user to receive messages now setup is complete
  inAppMessaging().setMessagesDisplaySuppressed(false);
}
```
