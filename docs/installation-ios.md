# iOS Installation

Please note that there is a known issue when using Cocoapods with the `use_frameworks!` enabled.  This is explained [here](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/252#issuecomment-316340974).  Unfortunately we don't currently have a workaround, but are engaging with Firebase directly to try and resolve the problem.

## 1) Setup GoogleService-Info.plist
Setup the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file by following the instructions and adding it to the root of your project at `ios/[YOUR APP NAME]/GoogleService-Info.plist` [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app).

**NOTE:** Unfortunately pasting the file into the directory doesn't automatically add the file to the iOS project. You need to manually add it (which I only know how to do within XCode) by

  1. Right click on your project
  1. Click "Add files to 'project name'"
  1. Select the .plist file
  1. Click ok

### 1.1) Initialisation
Make sure you've added the following to the top of your `ios/[YOUR APP NAME]]/AppDelegate.m` file:

`#import <Firebase.h>`

and this to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions` method before the `return` statement:

`[FIRApp configure];`

## 2) Setup RNFirebase

Unfortunately, due to the fact that Firebase is much easier to setup using Cocoapods, *we do not recommend* `react-native link` as it is not customisable enough for our needs and we have had numerous problems reported.

### 2.0) If you don't already have Cocoapods set up
Follow the instructions to install Cocoapods and create your Podfile [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_the_sdk).

**NOTE: The Podfile needs to be initialised in the `ios` directory of your project. Make sure to update cocoapods libs first by running `pod update`**

#### Troubleshooting
1) When running `pod install` you may encounter an error saying that a `tvOSTests` target is declared twice. This appears to be a bug with `pod init` and the way that react native is set up.

**Resolution:**
- Open your Podfile
- Remove the duplicate `tvOSTests` target nested within the main project target
- Re-run `pod install`.

2) When running `pod install` you may encounter a number of warnings relating to `target overrides 'OTHER_LDFLAGS'`.

**Resolution:**
- Open Xcode
- Select your project
- For each target:
-- Select the target
-- Click Build settings
-- Search for `other linker flags`
-- Add `$(inherited)` as the top line if it doesn't already exist
- Re-run `pod install`

3) When running `pod install` you may encounter a warning that a default iOS platform has been assigned.  If you wish to specify a different minimum version:

**Resolution**
- Open your Podfile
- Uncomment the `# platform :ios, '9.0'` line by removing the `#` character
- Change the version as required

### 2.1) Check the Podfile platform version
We recommend using a minimum platform version of at least 9.0 for your application to ensure that the correct version of the Firebase libraries are used.  To do this, you need to uncomment or make sure the following line is present at the top of your `Podfile`:

`platform :ios, '9.0'`

### 2.2) Add the required pods
Simply add the following to your `Podfile` either at the top level, or within the main project target:

```ruby
# Required by RNFirebase
pod 'Firebase/Core'
pod 'RNFirebase', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-firebase'

# [OPTIONAL PODS] - comment out pods for firebase products you won't be using.
pod 'Firebase/AdMob'
pod 'Firebase/Auth'
pod 'Firebase/Crash'
pod 'Firebase/Database'
pod 'Firebase/DynamicLinks'
pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
pod 'Firebase/Messaging'
pod 'Firebase/RemoteConfig'
pod 'Firebase/Storage'
```

If you do not already have React and Yoga installed as pods, then add Yoga and React to your `Podfile` as follows:

```ruby
pod "Yoga", :path => "../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga"
pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native', :subspecs => [
  'BatchedBridge', # Required For React Native 0.45.0+
  'Core',
  # Add any other subspecs you want to use in your project
]

#Also add this at the very bottom of your Podfile

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    if target.name == "React"
      target.remove_from_project
    end
  end
end
```

Run `pod install`.

**NOTE: You need to use the `ios/[YOUR APP NAME].xcworkspace` instead of the `ios/[YOUR APP NAME].xcproj` file from now on.**

#### Troubleshooting
1) You receive an error `No podspec found for 'RNFirebase'`

**Resolution**
- Run `npm install --save react-native-firebase` from the root of your project

## 3) Cloud Messaging (optional)

If you plan on using [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) then, you need to:

**NOTE: FCM does not work on the iOS simulator, you must test is using a real device.  This is a restriction enforced by Apple for some unknown reason.**

### 3.1) Set up certificates

Follow the instructions at https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs

### 3.2) Enable capabilities

In Xcode, enable the following capabilities:

1) Push Notifications
2) Background modes > Remote notifications

### 3.3) Update `AppDelegate.h`

Add the following import:

`@import UserNotifications;`

Change the interface descriptor to:

`@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate,UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>`

### 3.4) Update `AppDelegate.m`

Add the following import:

`#import "RNFirebaseMessaging.h"`

Add the following to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions` method after `[FIRApp Configure]`:

`[[UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter] setDelegate:self];`

Add the following methods:

```objectivec
-(void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification {
  [RNFirebaseMessaging didReceiveLocalNotification:notification];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(nonnull NSDictionary *)userInfo {
  [RNFirebaseMessaging didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(nonnull NSDictionary *)userInfo
fetchCompletionHandler:(nonnull void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler{
  [RNFirebaseMessaging didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}

- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
       willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification
         withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions))completionHandler {
  [RNFirebaseMessaging willPresentNotification:notification withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}

- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response
         withCompletionHandler:(void (^)())completionHandler {
  [RNFirebaseMessaging didReceiveNotificationResponse:response withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}
```
