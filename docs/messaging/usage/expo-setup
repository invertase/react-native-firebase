Integrating the Cloud Messaging module on iOS devices requires additional setup before your devices receive messages.
There are also a number of prerequisites which are required to enable messaging:

- You must have an active [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action).
- You may use a physical iOS device to receive messages _or_ an iOS Simulator if you are on macOS 13+ on Apple Silicon using a Simulator running iOS 16+
  - Firebase Cloud Messaging integrates with the [Apple Push Notification service (APNs)](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/),
    however APNs only works with real devices or Apple Silicon macs running relatively new versions


## Prerequisites
Before your application can start to receive messages, you need to do have followed the steps in the [Installation for React Native CLI projects](https://rnfirebase.io/#installation-for-react-native-cli-projects) 
to generate and download `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) files. 

## Configuration
- Place `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` in your project root directory.
- Set the following in `app.json` (_remember to change `android.package` and `ios.bundleIdentifier`_)

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "android": {
      "googleServicesFile": "./google-services.json",
      "package": "com.mycorp.myapp"
    },
    "ios": {
      "googleServicesFile": "./GoogleService-Info.plist",      
      "entitlements": {
        "aps-environment": "development"
      },
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.mycorp.myapp",
      "infoPlist": {        
        "UIBackgroundModes": ["fetch", "remote-notification"]
      }
    },
    "plugins": [
      "@react-native-firebase/app",
      "@react-native-firebase/messaging",
      [
        "expo-build-properties",
        {
          "ios": {
            "useFrameworks": "static"
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```
- Finally, run `npx expo prebuild`
