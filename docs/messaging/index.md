# Firebase Cloud Messaging

React Native Firebase provides native integration of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for both Android & iOS. FCM is a
cost free service, allowing for server-device and device-device communication. The React Native Firebase Messaging
module provides a simple JavaScript API to interact with FCM.

The Messaging module is only responsible for handling data-only messages. To learn how to display notifications to
users, view the <Anchor group="notifications" href="/">Notifications</Anchor> module.
