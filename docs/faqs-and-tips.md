# FAQs

### I need help with [anything regarding <= v5 of React Native Firebase]. Where could I get help with that?

React Native Firebase v5 is now deprecated and unsupported. There's been over a year's grace period provided to migrate to v6, so moving forward maintainers probably won't pay much attention to issues regarding v5. Understandably, upgrading to v6 can take some effort, but staying on v5 probably isn't a great choice for the long-term health of your project.
Lots of the breaking changes that were introduced were either due to upstream deprecations in the official SDKs, or to simply make the package more stable and more representative of how the actual SDKs work.
The longer you stay on v5, the more your project will be out of sync with the official SDKs, unfortunately. Couple that with the fact that it's no longer actively supported, and that's trouble looming over the horizon for your project.

We highly recommend taking the necessary pains to update to v6.
