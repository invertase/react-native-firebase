Over the years, thereâ€™s been a lot of discussions on our [GitHub](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase) and [Discord](https://invertase.link/discord). Many of them have been about common problems developers face when using our package, and some of them resulted in very good advice being given.

In order to save others time and frustration, this page has been created to document some of these common problems and good pieces of advice.
If you come across a discussion that results in great advice that can benefit many developers, or a discussion that resolves a problem that many developers encounter, please do add it here! Someone will definitely be grateful.

# FAQs

### I need help with [anything regarding <= v5 of React Native Firebase]. Where could I get help with that?

React Native Firebase v5 is now deprecated and unsupported. There's been over a year's grace period provided to migrate to v6, so moving forward maintainers probably won't pay much attention to issues regarding v5. Understandably, upgrading to v6 can take some effort, but staying on v5 probably isn't a great choice for the long-term health of your project.
Lots of the breaking changes that were introduced were either due to upstream deprecations in the official SDKs, or to simply make the package more stable and more representative of how the actual SDKs work.
The longer you stay on v5, the more your project will be out of sync with the official SDKs, unfortunately. Couple that with the fact that it's no longer actively supported, and that's trouble looming over the horizon for your project.

We highly recommend taking the necessary pains to update to v6.

### My CI build hangs at the "Running script '[CP-User] [RNFB] Core Configuration'" step. 

This may be fixed by creating a `firebase.json` file at the root of your project if it's not there already. If you don't want to change any of the default React Native Firebase configurations, you can leave it empty in the following way: 

```
{
  "react-native": {
  }
}
```


### I have a custom Analytics parameter called 'items' and it's not showing up on the Firebase console. How come?

This happens to be a known problem with the upstream Analytics SDKs. The Firebase team doesn't have any plans to fix it soon. More information about this can be found [here](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/4018#issuecomment-682174087).


# Tips

- Whenever you face a strange issue (or an issue that causes build errors), there are two things you should always consider.
  - Build processes are costly and complex, so caching is used a lot. As a result, certain changes that you make in your app can cause cache conflicts in subsequent builds. Deal with this via `npx react-native-clean-project`. This does solve a lot of problems.
  - Try an isolate the problem with a template React Native Firebase app. This [bash script](https://github.com/mikehardy/rnfbdemo/blob/master/make-demo.sh) is particularly helpful in making an empty template app.
- Advice on supporting multiple environments (for example, dev, prod, maybe also staging, qa) for your React Native Firebase App: [#3504](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/3504)
- Using [Fastlane for iOS deployment](https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios) together with [RN Firebase Crashlytics](https://rnfirebase.io/crashlytics/usage) within CI has been observed to cause builds that hang indefinitely. Using `setup_ci(force: true)` before building the application may solve the issue.: [#3706](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/3706)
