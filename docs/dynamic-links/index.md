# Dynamic Links

Firebase Dynamic Links are a modern alternative to deep links, providing configurable links that provide the user with the
best available experience according to which platform they are using and whether your app is already installed. Firebase
Dynamic Links can take users directly to the linked content in your app and even let this info persist through an app install.
