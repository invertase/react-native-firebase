# AdMob with Firebase

Admob is now a part of Firebase, allowing you to bring high quality ads to your React Native application
whilst taking advantage of other Firebase service such as Analytics. React Native Firebase provides integration with
[Banner Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=admob),
[Interstitial Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/interstitial?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=admob)
and [Rewarded Video Ads](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/rewarded-video?utm_source=invertase&utm_medium=react-native-firebase&utm_campaign=admob).
