# AdMob Quick Start

> This module has not yet been migrated as part of the on-going v6 work.

## Installation

Install this module with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-firebase/admob
```

> Integrating manually and not via React Native auto-linking? Check the setup instructions for <Anchor version group href="/android">Android</Anchor> & <Anchor version group href="/ios">iOS</Anchor>.

## Module usage

The AdMob package provides a JavaScript API for integrating event based adverts such as Interstitial Ads and
React component view adverts such as Banner Ads.

Import the Cloud Functions package into your project:

```js
import admob from '@react-native-firebase/admob';
```

The package also provides access to the firebase instance:

```js
import { firebase } from '@react-native-firebase/admob';
```
