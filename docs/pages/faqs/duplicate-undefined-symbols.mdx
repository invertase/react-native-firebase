# Duplicate Symbols / Undefined Symbols

Running updates to your project with multiple and/or changing versions can cause XCode to become
confused about the expected version required to build your project. The can happen when updating to a
new version of React Native Firebase, or updating another projects pods.

Fixing the error requires the project to be cleaned and the projects dependancies to be re-installed:

1. Open the `/ios/.xcworkspace` file using XCode.
2. Select Product > Clean Build Folder.
3. Close XCode fully.
4. From your terminal, run `pod install` from the project `/ios` directory.
5. Reopen the `/ios/.xcworkspace` file using XCode.
6. Rerun Product > Clean Build Folder.
7. Rerun your iOS build.
