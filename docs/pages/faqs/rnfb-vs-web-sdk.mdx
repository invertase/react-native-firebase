# React Native Firebase vs Firebase Web SDK

The [Firebase web SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) is a JavaScript
package available on Node Package Manager (NPM), supporting both the web (browser) and
server (Node.js) clients. Firebase offers a magnitude of services for your application, however, some of these
some services are tailored towards native Android & iOS devices.

React Native Firebase (RNF) provides a JavaScript interface into the native Firebase
[Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) and
[iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) SDKs. For added benefit, we've
tried to ensure that our library mimics that of the web SDK where possible.

There are both advantages and disadvantages to using React Native Firebase over the Firebase
web SDK.

## Advantages

### Native modules

In the React Native ecosystem, native modules are referred to when the module in question utilises the
underlying device APIs. React Native provides native access to both Android and iOS devices,
allowing developers to create JavaScript modules which interface with native APIs.

With the native Firebase SDKs installed, React Native Firebase provides a JavaScript module which allows
developers to interface with the native modules which wouldn't otherwise be available via the web SDK.
For example, the Firebase Analytics module logs advanced information such as the users device Android/iOS
version with every event, something which is only possible with the use of native modules.

### Performance

Performance is prehaps the most important aspect of any production application. The [React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/performance) does a great
job of explaining performance within React Native.

RNF performs all resource intenstive tasks using native APIs, taking advantage of complex concepts
such as [threading](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/processes-and-threads). Keeping these tasks
native ensures that the UI or JavaScript threads are kept free for critial user actions such as touch
events or scrolling, helping remove [jank](http://jankfree.org/).

## Disadvantages

### Initial setup

Installing a React Native module which uses native modules requires knowledge of the Android
and iOS environments. Developers with little or no experience of these environements may find
the initial installation process complex and daunting, or encounter issues with process due to their
local environment setup.

To help overcome this process, the following list of resources are worth bookmarking and understanding
before diving into native modules:

### Firebase changes

Firebase are constantly improving their service with regular [updates and changes](https://firebase.google.com/support/releases?authuser=0).

Although the developers here at Invertase strive to keep the library inline with the web SDK,
there may be times where the implememtation of new feaatures and changes lag behind the offical SDK.
