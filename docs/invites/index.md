# Invites

> Firebase Invites is deprecated. On January 24th, 2020, support will be discontinued for Firebase Invites. Learn how to migrate to <Anchor href="/migrate-to-dynamic-links">Dynamic Links</Anchor> with a customs sharing solution.

React Native Firebase provides native integration of Firebase Invites, allowing you to build your own invitations
to send to friends with a JavaScript API. Send simple or rich HTML emails to users, and then build a custom invite
handler directly within your React Native app.
