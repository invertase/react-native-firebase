# Migrating to Dynamic Links

Starting on January 24th, 2020, your users will no longer be able to send or receive Firebase Invites, and the
invites backend service will start returning error responses when making calls to send and receive an invite link. To
learn more about this, see the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/invites/deprecation).
