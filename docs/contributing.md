## Pull Request Management

- Updates must not change the API surface area unless discussed on our [Discord](https://invertase.link/discord) server.

# Documentation

All documentation is open sourced and we are happy to accept contributions whether they are typo fixes or new pages.
Content is written in Markdown, and takes advantage of [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx) to provide powerful functionality on-top of Markdown.

Our documentation reference is automatically generated from each packages TypeScript declaration. Our build process
automatically generates a `typedoc.json` file using TypeDoc, which is then parsed into a consumable format for our documentation generator.

# Community

We'd love to help promote the event via:

- Twitter exposure on our [@rnfirebase](https://twitter.com/rnfirebase) account.

- Giving out React Native Firebase T-Shirts.
- Sending stickers of the library logo.
