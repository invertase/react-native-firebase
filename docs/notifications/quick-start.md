## Installation

This module depends on the `@react-native-firebase/app` module. To get started and install `app`,
visit the project's <Anchor version={false} group={false} href="/quick-start">quick start</Anchor> guide.

Install this module with Yarn:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-firebase/notifications
```

## Module usage

Import the Performance Monitoring package into your project:

```
