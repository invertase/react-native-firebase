# iOS Manual Installation

The following steps are only required if you are using React Native <= 0.59 or need to manually integrate the library.

Installation can be done via CocoaPods (recommended) or via Frameworks:

## CocoaPods Installation

### Add the RNFBAnalytics Pod

Add the `RNFBAnalytics` Pod to your projects `/ios/Podfile`:

```ruby{3}
target 'app' do
  ...
  pod 'RNFBAnalytics', :path => '../node_modules/@react-native-firebase/analytics'
end
```

### Update Pods & rebuild the project

You may need to update your local Pods in order for the `RNFBAnalytics` Pod to be installed in your project:

```bash
$ cd /ios/
$ pod install --repo-update
```

Once the Pods have installed locally, rebuild your iOS project:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Device Identification

If you would like to enable Firebase Analytics to generate automatic audience metrics for iOS (as it does by default in Android), you must link additional iOS libraries, [as documented by the Google Firebase team](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039). Specifically you need `libAdIdAccess.a` and `AdSupport.framework`.

The way to do this using Cocoapods is to add this to your Podfile (though please use [the most current Pod version](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GoogleIDFASupport) supported by react-native-firebase):

**`ios/Podfile`**:

```ruby{5}
// ..
target 'app' do
  // ..
  pod 'RNFBAnalytics', :path => '../node_modules/@react-native-firebase/analytics'
  pod 'GoogleIDFASupport', '~> 3.14.0'
end
```
