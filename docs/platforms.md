## Status

By default React Native Firebase supports multiple platforms using the native Firebase SDK for the specific platform:

- Android
- iOS

However, for platforms that we don't provide a Native Module for, React Native Firebase instead implements a fallback Firebase JS SDK implementation to support
these 'Other' platforms, e.g.;

- Web
- macOS
- Windows
- ...and any other RN based environment.

Below is a table outlining which Firebase modules are supported on each platform in React Native Firebase:

| Firebase Service | Android | iOS | Other |
| ---------------- | :-----: | :-: | :---: |
| analytics        |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟢   |
| app-check        |   🟠    | 🟠  |  🟠   |
| app-distribution |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| app              |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟢   |
| auth             |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟠   |
| crashlytics      |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| database         |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟢   |
| dynamic-links    |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| firestore        |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟠   |
| functions        |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟢   |
| in-app-messaging |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| installations    |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| messaging        |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| ml               |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| perf             |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🔴   |
| remote-config    |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟢   |
| storage          |   🟢    | 🟢  |  🟠   |

- 🟢 (supported)
- 🟠 (partial support) - see notes below
- 🔴 (not supported)

## Other Platforms

Whenever the React Native Firebase SDK is running on platforms other than Android
or iOS, the internal implementation uses a fallback platform which is implemented
in JavaScript, using the [Firebase JavaScript Modular SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js).

No implementation changes are required to use the React Native Firebase SDK on
other platforms (with the exception of Async Storage detailed below), as the
JavaScript implementation is automatically used when a native platform is not
available. This allows you to use the same API across all platforms, regardless
of the underlying implementation.

There are however some minor limitations or differences in behavior compared
to the native platforms. Where a particular method is not supported, an error
will be thrown with a code of `unsupported` to indicate the method is not
available on the current platform.

Further details of Firebase service specific limitations are summarized below.

### Async Storage

Some services (currently Auth and Analytics) for our 'Other' platforms
implementation require a Async Storage implementation to be provided to
enable persistence, React Native Firebase provides an API to set this implementation:

```js
import firebase from '@react-native-firebase/app';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// Before initializing Firebase set the Async Storage implementation
// that will be used to persist user sessions.
firebase.setReactNativeAsyncStorage(AsyncStorage);

// Then initialize Firebase as normal.
await firebase.initializeApp({ ... });
```

> Note: we use `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` as an example, you should use the Async Storage implementation that is appropriate for your platform that you are targeting.

If you do not provide an Async Storage implementation, we use an in memory implementation
which will result in resetting the data every time your app is restarted, in the case of
Firebase Auth this means your users have to sign in again.

### Analytics

The other platform implementation of Analytics does not capture automatic metrics like screen view, you must call `logEvent` and other logging based methods to send your events to Firebase.

- [Screen Tracking Guide](/analytics/screen-tracking)

### App Check

App Check for other platforms only supports the `CustomProvider` provider. Here's how to setup your own custom provider:

- [Implement server support to get tokens](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/custom-provider)
- Create a custom provider in your app:

```js
import firebase, { CustomProvider, initializeAppCheck } from '@react-native-firebase/app-check';

const myCustomProvider = new CustomProvider({
  async getToken: () => {
    // TODO: Get the token from your server, e.g. if using a cloud function call the function.
    const tokenFromServer = 'some-token-from-server';
    const expirationFromServer = 1000 * 60 * 60; // 1 hour
    const appCheckToken = {
      token: tokenFromServer,
      expireTimeMillis: expirationFromServer * 1000
    };
    return appCheckToken;
  }
});

// Configure the provider (modular API)
initializeAppCheck(firebaseApp, {
  provider: myCustomProvider
});

// Or configure the provider (v8 API)
firebase.appCheck().initializeAppCheck({ provider: myCustomProvider });
```

### Authentication

Multi-factor authentication is not supported on other platforms.

Phone authentication methods are unsupported, specifically:

- `signInWithProvider`
- `signInWithPhoneNumber`
- `verifyPhoneNumberForMultiFactor`
- `confirmationResultConfirm`
- `verifyPhoneNumber`
- `reauthenticateWithProvider`

### Database

Offline persistence is not supported on other platforms.

Unsupported methods:

- `keepSynced` - for offline persistence

### Firestore

For performance reasons and to reduce the size of the JavaScript bundle, the Other platform implementation in
React Native Firebase uses the JavaScript [lite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firestore_lite) SDK,
which does not support methods related to offline & persistence.

Specifically, the following methods are not supported:

- `loadBundle`
- `clearPersistence` - for offline persistence
- `disableNetwork` - for offline persistence
- `enableNetwork` - for offline persistence
- `namedQuery`
- `onSnapshot` (for both `CollectionReference` & `DocumentReference`)
- `GetOptions.source`

### Storage

No-op methods:

- `setMaxDownloadRetryTime` (does not throw, but has no effect)

Unsupported methods:

- `writeToFile`
- `putFile`
